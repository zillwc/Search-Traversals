        <p class="lead">Iterative Deepening Depth First Search</p>
        <p>It is a state space search strategy in which a depth-limited search is run repeatedly, increasing the depth limit with each iteration until it reaches the depth of the shallowest goal state.</p>
        <p>It is similar to the breadth-first search, but uses much less memory. On each iteration, it visits the nodes in the same fashion as depth-first search, but the order in which nodes are first visited is equivalent to breadth-first.</p>
        <p>This is the advantage the search has over the Depth-Limited Search but it is also the searches disadvantage because if the graph's paths are long, the time and complexity is greatly increased.</p>

        <p class="lead">Greedy Search</p>
        <p>This search follows the path of nodes by making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. The problem with this search is that the goal is not always found; However, if the goal is found, it is best to assume that the path found is the best way to the goal with the cost in mind.</p>
        <p>There is no backtracking with this algorithm. Unlike most other searches, greedy search tends to only think in the present optimal solution, instead of the optimal future solution. Yes, the algorithm can save us a lot of computing (no sorting of the queue or exploring alternates) but since there is no guarantee of finding the optimal solution, the algorithm usually isn't best method of search.</p>
